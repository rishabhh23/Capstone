GridSec is conceived to bridge 
divides in cybersecurity by weaving seven core capabilities into a single, cohesive workbench. It begins with a 
real-time overview dashboard that displays incident counts, high-risk tallies, monetary loss, and 
response times in an interactive interface that updates instantly as filters change. Time-series analytics 
reveal daily incident and loss patterns alongside heat-maps that expose which weekdays tend to see 
spikes in high-risk events. Geographic insights come to life in a world map colored by incident density 
and loss, paired with asset-breakdown charts and drill-downs into top source IPs.
